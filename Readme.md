# Solana AMM Implementation Using Anchor

Welcome to the Automated Market Maker (AMM) implementation on Solana, built using the Anchor framework. This project provides essential functionalities for decentralized trading, enabling users to initialize a market, deposit tokens, swap between different tokens, and withdraw their assets. Below is a detailed overview of the key features of this AMM.

## Features

### 1. Initialize
- **Description**: This function initializes the AMM by setting up the necessary accounts and liquidity pools. It establishes the foundation for users to deposit tokens and start trading.
- **Functionality**:
    - Sets up liquidity pools for the supported token pairs.
    - Initializes the necessary accounts and program state.
    - Prepares the AMM for deposits, swaps, and withdrawals.

### 2. Deposit
- **Description**: This function allows users to deposit tokens into the liquidity pool. In return, users receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, representing their share in the pool.
- **Functionality**:
    - Deposits the user's tokens into the specified liquidity pool.
    - Mints and transfers LP tokens to the user as proof of their contribution.
    - Updates the pool's state to reflect the new liquidity.

### 3. Swap
- **Description**: This function facilitates the swapping of one token for another within the AMM. It uses the constant product formula to determine the swap rate, ensuring a decentralized and automated trading experience.
- **Functionality**:
    - Allows users to swap between supported tokens in the liquidity pool.
    - Calculates the swap rate based on the current pool reserves and the constant product formula.
    - Updates the pool's reserves and user's balances accordingly.

### 4. Withdraw
- **Description**: This function enables users to withdraw their tokens from the liquidity pool. Users can redeem their LP tokens to receive their share of the pool's reserves, plus any accrued fees.
- **Functionality**:
    - Burns the user's LP tokens in exchange for their share of the liquidity pool.
    - Transfers the corresponding tokens from the pool to the user.
    - Updates the pool's state to reflect the withdrawal.
